        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> At \\( t = 6\\,\\mathrm{s} \\), the graph shows the student at a displacement of \\(2.0\,\\mathrm{m}\\). The velocity is the gradient (slope) of the displacement-time graph:
          \\[
          v = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}
          \\]
          The student moves from \\(-1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) to \\(2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) over \\(6\\,\\mathrm{s}\\), so:
          \\[

          \\[
          v = \\frac{3.0}{6} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}
          \\]
          Therefore, the final displacement is \\(2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) and the velocity is \\(0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\\).

      <ul>

            <li><strong>Force</strong>: This is a vector quantity, as it has both magnitude and direction.</li>

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a velocity-time graph:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The problem gives the vertical and horizontal components of velocity, which are perpendicular to each other. The resultant velocity is found using the Pythagorean theorem:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The magnitude of the resultant velocity \\( v \\) is given by: 
            \\[
            v = \\sqrt{v_{\\text{vertical}}^2 + v_{\\text{horizontal}}^2}

        <li><strong>For the angle,</strong> we can use the tangent of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the resultant velocity and the vertical component of the velocity:</li>

          <li>The angle \\( \\theta \\) is given by:

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Let's break down each pair of units to identify if they are equivalent or not.</li>
        <li><strong>Option A: Unit 1: Js‚Åª¬π; Unit 2: W</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{Js}^{-1} \\) (joule-seconds inverse) represents power, which is equivalent to the unit \\( \\text{W} \\) (watts). These units are equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Option B: Unit 1: kgms‚Åª¬≤; Unit 2: Ns</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{kgms}^{-2} \\) (kilogram meter per second squared) represents force (newton), while \\( \\text{Ns} \\) (newton-second) represents momentum. These are different physical quantities, so they are not equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Option C: Unit 1: Nkg‚Åª¬π; Unit 2: ms‚Åª¬≤</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{Nkg}^{-1} \\) (newton per kilogram) represents gravitational field strength, which has the same units as \\( \\text{ms}^{-2} \\) (meters per second squared), which represents acceleration. These units are equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Option D: Unit 1: Nm; Unit 2: J</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{Nm} \\) (newton meter) is equivalent to the unit \\( \\text{J} \\) (joule), both representing energy or work. These units are equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, Option B is the correct answer, as the units \\( \\text{kgms}^{-2} \\) and \\( \\text{Ns} \\) are not equivalent.</p>

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a sphere falls through a viscous liquid, two main forces oppose its motion:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Upthrust:</strong> This is the buoyant force due to the displaced liquid. It depends only on the volume of the sphere and the density of the liquid, both of which are constant. Thus, the upthrust remains <strong>constant</strong> as the sphere falls.</li>
            <li><strong>Viscous Drag:</strong> This force, according to Stokes' Law, is proportional to the velocity \\( v \\) of the sphere:

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The stiffness of the spring, denoted by \\( k \\), is determined by Hooke's Law, which relates force and displacement:
          \\[
          F = k \\times x
          \\]
          where \\( F \\) is the force applied and \\( x \\) is the displacement from the natural length. The change in length of the spring is given by \\( \Delta x = x_{1} - x_{2} \\), where \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are the spring lengths at the forces 50N and 70N respectively.

          Rearranging Hooke's Law, the spring constant \\( k \\) can be calculated from the change in force and the change in displacement:
          \\[
          k = \\frac{F_2 - F_1}{x_1 - x_2}
          \\]
          where \\( F_1 = 50N \\), \\( F_2 = 70N \\), \\( x_1 = 12.0 \\) cm, and \\( x_2 = 7.1 \\) cm. Therefore, the expression for \\( k \\) becomes:
          \\[
          k = \\frac{70 - 50}{12.0 - 7.1} = \\frac{20}{4.9}

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this scenario, we are dealing with energy transfer when a compressed spring is released. The potential energy stored in the spring is converted into kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.</li>
        <li>The force <i>F</i> compresses the spring by a distance <i>Œîx</i>. The energy stored in the spring as potential energy is given by:

      <h3>‚úÖ Why is Option B correct?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, when two forces form a Newton's third law pair, they act on <strong>different bodies</strong> but are of the same type of force. These forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Newton's third law can be expressed as:
          \\[

            <li>\\( F_{2} \\) is the force exerted on the second body.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For a Newton's third law pair, the forces are always of the same magnitude but act in opposite directions on different bodies.</li>
        <li>Hence, Option B is correct because it describes forces that are of the same type and act on different bodies.</li>

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a ball bearing falls at terminal velocity, the forces acting on it are balanced. The viscous drag \\( F_d \\) balances the effective weight:

          <ul>

        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The weight \\( W \\) of the bird is supported by the tension in the string, which has vertical and horizontal components. The vertical component of the tension must balance the weight of the bird. Since the string makes an angle of 80¬∞ with each vertical post, the vertical component of the tension is given by:

            \\[
            v = \\sqrt{v_{\\text{vertical}}^2 + v_{\\text{horizontal}}^2}

            \\[
            v = \\sqrt{5^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 64} = \\sqrt{89} 
            \\]
            Hence, the magnitude of the resultant velocity is \\( \\sqrt{8^2 + 5^2} \\), which matches Option C.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>For the angle,</strong> we can use the tangent of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the resultant velocity and the vertical component of the velocity:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The angle \\( \\theta \\) is given by:
            \\[
            \\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{v_{\\text{horizontal}}}{v_{\\text{vertical}}} \\right)

          <li>The unit \\( \\text{kgms}^{-2} \\) (kilogram meter per second squared) represents force (newton), while \\( \\text{Ns} \\) (newton-second) represents momentum. These are different physical quantities, so they are not equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Option C: Unit 1: Nkg‚Åª¬π; Unit 2: ms‚Åª¬≤</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{Nkg}^{-1} \\) (newton per kilogram) represents gravitational field strength, which has the same units as \\( \\text{ms}^{-2} \\) (meters per second squared), which represents acceleration. These units are equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Option D: Unit 1: Nm; Unit 2: J</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The unit \\( \\text{Nm} \\) (newton meter) is equivalent to the unit \\( \\text{J} \\) (joule), both representing energy or work. These units are equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, Option B is the correct answer, as the units \\( \\text{kgms}^{-2} \\) and \\( \\text{Ns} \\) are not equivalent.</p>
